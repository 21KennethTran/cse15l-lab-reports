# Week 10 Lab Report

## 1. Comparing Test Results

In this part of the lab, I was given [my markdown-parser](https://github.com/21KennethTran/markdown-parser) and the following [markdown-parser implementation](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/MarkdownParse.java), where I would have to compare results when the [test-file](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/tree/main/test-files) containing hundreds of test cases were inputted. On my `ieng6` account, I used the provided `script.sh` to run and save the results of testing those files on both implementations of markdown-parser. I then used `vimdiff` to compare the results, as seen in the screenshot below:
